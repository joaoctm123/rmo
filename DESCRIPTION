Title: R Modern Optimization Package
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joao Carlos Torres Arantes Maia

Description:A vast number of real-world tasks can be viewed as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize or maximize a given goal. This package encompasses in a single and simply to use function (rmoptim) several modern optimization algorithms (metaheuristics) that are spread across distinct packages. Examples of implemented methods are: grid search, hill climbing, tabu search, simulated annealing, differential evolution, estimation of distribution algorithms, genetic and evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony.
